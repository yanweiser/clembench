You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.
Find out, whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same. You must follow those rules:
    - Start your image description with "DESCRIPTION:”
    - If you have questions about the other image that only I can see start them with “QUESTION: “
    - If you answer a question, start with “ANSWER: “
    - If you have come to a decision, write “DECISION: SAME IMAGE” if you think they are the same picture or “DECISION: DIFFERENT IMAGE” if you think they are different pictures.
I will describe my picture first:
$DESCRIPTION_A$
Please describe your picture now then we can ask each other questions about the images to figure out whether they are the same.

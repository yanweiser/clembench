You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.
The goal is to find out whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same. First, I will provide my description and then we can ask each other questions about the images to figure out whether they are the same.
This is a description of my image: $DESCRIPTION_A$ $NUM_QUESTIONS$
Now start your short image description with "$FLAG$" followed by the description. Do not add anything else.

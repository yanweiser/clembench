Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit every room on a map with the fewest number of room changes possible. 
In each room you need to decide the direction to go in. 
Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and choose to stop the game at that point. 

Remember! Your answer needs to follow these constructions: 
“GO: <direction>”: to make a step, replace direction with one of [north, south, east, west]. 
“DONE”: This will end the game and we will be graded. To maximize our score we need to maximize the number of different rooms we have seen
and minimize the number of steps we have taken.

Let us start. You are in the initial room. Currently available directions: $INITIAL_DIRECTIONS$. What is your next instruction?

    "## Prototyping a game\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up a game, we need two things. First, we need what we shall call a MOVE RULE. This (kind of) rule defines what *form* a valid game move must take. (Having this form enables us to parse it and to even understand in the first place what the move was. For example, if we were to play chess and we would define that requested moves have to follow the [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) notation, then `e2e4` would validate (because it is in that format), and `Nf3` would not (and neither would the text `I will move my knight to F3` and similar).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is independent of the question of whether `e2e4` is a legal move in the current game state. These kinds of things are defined by the GAME RULEs. These rules determine what effect valid (= well-formed) moves have on the current game state: whether they are legal, and whether they update the game state, and if so, whether they perhaps even update the game into a goal state. We might also want to define other criteria that determine whether the game goes on or not, like a limit on the number of turns the game is played.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is important to keep in mind when setting up a clemgame is that both move and game rules need to be checkable *programmatically* (by the game master that you need to implement). That is, it shouldn't require the kind of \"intelligence\" that you want to test in the first place. Anything that is formally define-able should be ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try a very simple game. A and B are supposed to have a conversation, but in each of their turns, the first letter must be such that taken together, the sequence of first letters follows the sequence in the alphabet, with a given starting letter. So if that starting letter is 'h', the first utterance start with h, the second with i, and so on. This is the GAME RULE. If any player violates that rule, the game ends as a failure. If however the rule has not been violated for $n$ turns, it's a success. (The MOVE RULE is \"start your utterance with 'I SAY:'\". If the output of the player does not have this form, it is rejected. This can lead to a re-prompt (explaining again the move rule), or it can lead to the game being abandoned.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(This is not a terribly good game, as it does not require the integration of information across very many turns -- you just need to look at the previous turn to know which letter you are supposed to use.

But it might not be a bad idea at the end of your session to clean up what you have, and prepare something that looks more like this notebook.
